# DesignPatternsExamples
Small console applications demonstrating common design patterns based on Dmitri Nesteruk's course on .NET Design Patterns. *** under development ***

Small update regarding Liskov Substituion Principle (in SOLID):
  My oppinion is that the Liskov example application is WRONG! Square is not a kind of Rectangle, therefore you shouldn't extend Squeare from Rectangle!
